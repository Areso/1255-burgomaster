Hello!  
So, you want to contribute something to the game?  
That's wonderful!  
I am no joking.  
First, please, check the Roadmap https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster/projects/1  
If you're not good at coding, which happens, you still could help with:  
1) correcting translations https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster/tree/master/langs (preferable method with PR) or at google docs https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxRoxfPpYBHqvWb4mQNxGVr3r4VyxHSEuELzdU1I2PE
2) drawing resources (contact me, if you don't know what to draw - I have a lot of to draw, but myself is bad at drawing)  
3) writing textes. Indeed, the game have a scenario, but it is weak, and could be improved. If you are good at writing such things - contact me  
4) finally, you could just propose almost everything you would like to see in the game, and the ideas I like I will write down, and, probably, someday, implement.  
5) well, if you bad at everything above, but have some spare bucks in your pocket, you could donate them to the project, so I could pay for the server (if your donate is small) or order a picture or two being drawn for the game. You will be awarded with a special effects in the chat, and my gratitude.

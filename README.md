		<h2>About the project</h2><br>
		Hello there! My name is  Anton Gladyshev, and I'm the author of this project. 
		The homepage of the project is <a href="https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster">https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster</a>. 
		This pet-project is dedicated to create a playable game, written in vanilla JavaScript, without even using jQuery and modern whistlers and jugglers, such as JS frameworks, TS->JS compilators, Node.js, web servers and so on. 
		Thus, to play the game, you need only a modern browser. To edit the game, you need only a text editor and imagination.
		The project is oriented to be compact (in terms of the source code and the resources), blazing fast to download, fast enough to run even on aging devices<br>
		It runs well even on low-powered tablets and phones, let alone old PCs and laptops.<br>
		It heavily uses JS technologies as HTML5.Canvas, EcmaScript5 localStorage, <span style="color:red"><font color="red">JSON.parse()</font></span>, and so on. So it requires a somewhat modern browser, with ES5/ES6 standarts support.<br>
		<br>				
		<h2>Minimum System Requirements</h2>
		Browsers: any modern browser, but the game tested only on Firefox and Google Chrome<br>
		1024MB RAM<br>
		800MHz 1 Core CPU<br>
		5MB of data plan to download the game itself, analytics, and chat. 
		And some traffic will be used with in-game chat and usage statistics, though the game will work perfectly even if a connection is lost after the download is complete. 
		You also may download the game, to run it in offline (check options offline game).<br> 
		<br>
		<h2>About the game</h2>
		<br>
		<img src="game_preview.jpg" alt="Screenshots">
		<br>
		Supported Languages(SL): English, Russian (Русский).<br>
		Community Supported Languages(CSL): German (Deutsch), Esperanto, French (Français)<br>
		Make note that my opportunity to translate the game to CSL is limited. I can answer in chat in supported languages and in Esperanto.<br>
		Also, any CSL translation could have mistakes or untranslated parts or parts of translation which are partly outdated.<br>
		You could help with translations for the game here:<br> 
		<a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxRoxfPpYBHqvWb4mQNxGVr3r4VyxHSEuELzdU1I2PE'>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxRoxfPpYBHqvWb4mQNxGVr3r4VyxHSEuELzdU1I2PE</a><br>
		This is a single-player game. There is built-in chat but it is not currently available to chat in.<br> 
		Also, the game now has global goals, which are usually activated for a limited time.<br>
		In those events, all players can work together to achieve a high global goal, and in case of the achievement, they all got a reward, according to their pledge in the achievement.<br> 
		The game itself is about building a city. You start with a set amount of gold and a few citizens.<br>
		This is an IDLE game, which means, every minute your city will spawn new citizens who will pay taxes to you.<br>
		You can construct as well as upgrade buildings, but upgrading existing ones will require more gold each time .<br>
		As of now, constructing building does not require time, only resources.<br> 
		Straight management, which means, you need place management by clicking here and there and you will get what you clicked.</br>
		What game offers now:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>13 buildings to build of 10 types</li>
		<li>maps to explore (HoMM3-like)</li>
		<li>autocampaigns (Fallout Shelter-like)</li>
		<li>a hero managemenet</li>
		<li>troops managemenet</li>
		<li>artifacts to collect</li>
		<li>executing people or placing festivals</li>
        <li>University with a tech tree</li>
		<li>random events: stealings from the treasury, fires and plagues</li>
		<li>time-limited events: Halloween, New Year</li>
		<li>two decoration themes: Summer and Winter</li>
		<li>a record table</li>
		</ul>
		<div style="color:red">You will explore wild territories near your city.</div><br>
		Regarding your choices, you could get a boost in taxes, birthrate, happiness and so on.<br>
		The game could become a clicker game if you build the Gallows, and like to execute your citizens.<br>
		This game created and new features right now in development inspired by Travian, Townsmen, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusaders, HoMM (Heroes of Might and Magic), Lord of Realm, Anno series.<br> 
		You can export and import save to transfer your progress between different browsers and PCs.<br><br>

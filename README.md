		<h2>About the project</h2><br>
		Hello there! My name is Gladyshev Anton, and I'm the author of the project. 
		The homepage of the project is <a href="https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster">https://github.com/Areso/1255-burgomaster</a>. 
		This pet-project is dedicated to create a playable game, written in vanilla JavaScript, without using even jQuery and modern whistlers and jugglers, such as JS frameworks, TS->JS compilators, Node.js, web servers and so on. 
		Thus, to play the game, you need only a modern browser. To edit the game, you need only a text editor and imagination.
		The project oriented to be compact (in terms of the source code and the resources), blazing fast to download, fast enough to run even on aging devices with limited horsepower under the hood.<br>
		It runs well even on low-powered tablets and phones, let alone old PCs and laptops.<br>
		It heavily uses JS technologies as HTML5.Canvas, EcmaScript5 localStorage, <span style="color:red"><font color="red">JSON.parse()</font></span>, and so on. So it requires a somewhat modern browser, with ES5/ES6 standarts support.<br>

		<br>
		Supported Languages(SL): English, Russian (Русский).<br>
		Community Supported Languages(CSL): German (Deutsch), Esperanto, French (Français)<br>
		Make note that my opportunity to translate the game to CSL is limited. I can answer in chat in supported languages and in Esperanto.<br>
		Also, any CSL translation could have mistakes or untranslated parts or parts of translation which are partly outdated.<br>
		You could help with translations for the game here:<br> 
		<a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxRoxfPpYBHqvWb4mQNxGVr3r4VyxHSEuELzdU1I2PE'>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxRoxfPpYBHqvWb4mQNxGVr3r4VyxHSEuELzdU1I2PE</a><br>
		This is a single-player game. There is built-in chat but it is not currently available to chat in.<br> 
		Also, the game now has global goals, which are usually activated for a limited time.<br>
		In those events, all players work together to achieve a high global goal, and in case of the achievement, they all got a reward, according to their pledge in the achievement.<br> 
		The game itself is about building a city. You with with a set amount of gold and a few citizens.<br>
		This is an IDLE game, which means, every minute your citizens will spawn new citizens and pay taxes to you.<br>
		You can construct buildings as well as upgrade buildings, but upgrading existing ones will require each time more gold.<br>
		As for now, constructing building does not require time, only resources.<br> 
		Straight management, which means, you need place management by clicking here and there and you will get what you clicked.</br>
		What game offers now:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>12 buildings to build of 9 types</li>
		<li>maps to explore (HoMM3-like)</li>
		<li>autocampaigns (Fallout Shelter-like)</li>
		<li>a hero managemenet</li>
		<li>troops managemenet</li>
		<li>artifacts to collect</li>
		<li>executing people</li>
		<li>placing festivals</li>
		<li>random events: stealings from the treasury, fires and plagues</li>
		<li>time-limited events: Halloween</li>
		<li>two decoration themes: Summer and Winter</li>
		<li>a record table</li>
		</ul>
		<div style="color:red">You will explore wild territories near your city.</div><br>
		Regarding your choices, you could get a boost in taxes, birthrate, happiness and so on.<br>
		The game could become a Clicker game if you build the Gallows, and like to execute you citizens.<br>
		This game created and new features right now in development inspired by Travian, Townsmen, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusaders, HoMM (Heroes of Might and Magic), Lord of Realm, Anno series.<br>
